## Introduction
This project summarizes key insights from NLP-focused conferences led by experts from major companies and research institutions. Each talk covers advancements in AI, semantic analysis, RAG, multimodal NLP, and ethical AI regulation.

To enhance understanding, word clouds visualize the most relevant terms, and similarity analysis highlights recurring themes across conferences. This document provides structured summaries, offering a clear view of current trends and innovations in NLP.

**! Important !** 
Everything presented comes directly from my notes! While they may sometimes lack consistency, they provide a solid overview of the conference content. I used ChatGPT to generate a summary and merged it with information from the conference PDFs.
