## Introduction
This project summarizes key insights from NLP-focused conferences led by experts from major companies and research institutions. Each talk covers advancements in AI, semantic analysis, RAG, multimodal NLP, and ethical AI regulation.

To enhance understanding, word clouds visualize the most relevant terms, and similarity analysis highlights recurring themes across conferences. This document provides structured summaries, offering a clear view of current trends and innovations in NLP.

Everything presented comes directly from my notes! While they may sometimes lack consistency, they provide a solid overview of the conference content. I used ChatGPT to generate a summary and merged it with information from the conference PDFs.

## Wordclouds
This section contains word clouds generated from each conference transcript. Word clouds visualize the most frequently used terms in a conference, helping to highlight key themes and recurring concepts.

📌 What you can find here:

One global word cloud aggregating all conferences.
Six individual word clouds (one per conference) showcasing the most prominent words.

## Wordfrequencies
This section presents bar charts of the most frequently used words in each conference, allowing for quantitative comparisons.

📌 What you can find here:

A top 10 word frequency chart for all conferences combined.
Six individual top 10 word frequency charts, showing which terms dominated each conference.

## Similarities
This section explores semantic similarities between the different conferences. Instead of just word counts, we use cosine similarity on word embeddings to measure topic overlap.

📌 What you can find here:

A heatmap showing similarity scores between all conferences.
Analysis of which conferences share the most content-related similarities.
